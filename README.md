# GPT-3-Playground

This is a small repo used by me to test some of the OpenAI API capabilities via a lightweight CLI.
So far it is just a program, which runs a loop and lets you enter a prompt and then provides you with the answer from the model `text-davinci-003`.

## Setup
To get started simply run `npm i` and create a .env file in the project directory in which you have to define the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. 
After that you can simply start the application with `npm start`
